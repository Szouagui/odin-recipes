    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Moroccan couscous is a flavorful and aromatic dish that is traditionally made with steamed semolina grains and a variety of vegetables, meat, or fish. The dish is typically seasoned with a blend of spices including cumin, coriander, turmeric, and paprika, which gives it a distinctive flavor and fragrance. The vegetables used in the dish can vary depending on the region, but common additions include carrots, onions, chickpeas, and zucchini. Meat such as lamb or chicken is often added for extra protein and flavor. The couscous is usually served with a spicy tomato sauce on the side, which is used to moisten the grains and add extra flavor. Moroccan couscous is a filling and satisfying meal that is perfect for sharing with friends and family.</p>
